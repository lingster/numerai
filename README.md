# Ling's Numerai notes

This repo contains notes and my findings on Numerai Datascience Tournament. 

## EDA folder
The folder EDA, contains a reasonable comprehensive set of reports from EDA(exploratory data analysis)
of the Numerai v5.0 dataset. This will be a useful first read to get a feel of the data and potentionally
what models to build to make predictions for the numerai challenge. 

## GraphQL 
Numerai provides a GraphQL endpoint that allows you to retrieve the performance of your models and other
data. 
The file: [`numerai_graphql.md`](numerai_graphql.md) provides details on how to access the GraphQL data and make queries to 
retrieve the data that you may need. 

Hope this will be useful to fellow datascientists out there! If anyone has any questions etc, feel free to 
raise an Issue in github, or you can find me in the Numerai discord.
