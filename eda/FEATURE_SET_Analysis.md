## Recommended Modeling Strategy

### Progressive Model Development
1. **Phase 1**: Start with "small" set for rapid iteration
2. **Phase 2**: Develop on "medium" set for production
3. **Phase 3**: Scale to "all" set for maximum performance
4. **Phase 4**: Experiment with thematic combinations

### Multi-Set Ensemble Strategy
1. **Core Models**: Train on small, medium, all sets
2. **Thematic Models**: Train specialized models on thematic sets
3. **Meta-Learning**: Combine predictions from different feature sets
4. **Set Validation**: Test generalization across feature sets

### Recommended Set Combinations

#### **High-Performance Ensemble**
- Base: "all" set (full information)
- Specialist 1: "intelligence" + "wisdom" (analytical)
- Specialist 2: "constitution" + "serenity" (stability)
- Specialist 3: "rain" + "sunshine" (environmental)

#### **Balanced Production**
- Primary: "medium" set (efficiency)
- Secondary: "v3_equivalent_features" (proven patterns)
- Validation: "small" set (robustness check)

#### **Experimental Research**
- RPG Combination: All thematic sets as individual models
- Temporal Mix: "sunshine" + "midnight" (contrast)
- Legacy Test: "v2_equivalent_features" vs "v3_equivalent_features"

## Implementation Recommendations

### Model Architecture by Feature Set

#### **Small Set (42 features)**
- **LightGBM**: `num_leaves=100`, `max_depth=6`
- **XGBoost**: `max_depth=4`, standard parameters
- **Neural Network**: 2-3 hidden layers, 64-128 neurons

#### **Medium Set (705 features)**  
- **LightGBM**: `num_leaves=500`, `max_depth=8`
- **XGBoost**: `max_depth=6`, higher regularization
- **TabNet**: `n_d=128`, `n_a=128`, `n_steps=4`

#### **All Set (2,376 features)**
- **LightGBM**: `num_leaves=1000+`, `max_depth=10+`
- **XGBoost**: `max_depth=8`, strong regularization
- **FT-Transformer**: Full capacity, attention mechanisms

### Cross-Validation Strategy
1. **Set-Specific CV**: Validate each feature set independently
2. **Set Generalization**: Train on one set, validate on another
3. **Progressive Validation**: Small → Medium → All progression
4. **Thematic Robustness**: Test across thematic boundaries

## Expected Outcomes

### Performance Hierarchy (Predicted)
1. **all** > **medium** > **small** (capacity-based)
2. **v3_equivalent_features** ≈ **medium** (curated quality)
3. **Thematic sets**: Variable, specialized performance
4. **rain** may outperform other thematic sets (size advantage)

### Model Selection Guidance
- **Speed Priority**: small set
