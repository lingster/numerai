# Discord

As some of the die hard discord users will know there is an active
discord channel for Numerai. If you are new like me and haven't the
time to read the entire history, then the dicord folder contains an 
archive of the key discord channels.

I've also used an LLM to pickout and summarise keys discussions so 
hopefully that will be useful for the community at large!

I have used the very useful DiscordChatExporter: 
https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter

To export chats!
